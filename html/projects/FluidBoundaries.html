This project investigates the evolving relationship between older adults and everyday objects in the kitchen. Through interviews, film, and object design, Fluid Boundaries 
reveals how care, independence, and adaptability intersect in domestic spaces. It centers the voices of older adults and caregivers to shape design solutions that respond with empathy, respect, and utility—bridging physical 
limitations and emotional needs with thoughtful, 
human-centered design.

                            This project began with my grandmother, who—at over ninety—has been 
permanently banned from the kitchen. Once the heart of our family gatherings and the cook behind all my favorite 
childhood meals, she now struggles 
with tasks that once came naturally. Her 
physical challenges have workarounds 
in many areas of life, but the kitchen, one of the most dangerous rooms in the house, filled with physical risk and rigid tools, offered few solutions. Fluid 
Boundaries was born from this gap: a 
desire to reimagine the kitchen as a safe, adaptable space where aging doesn’t mean exclusion.

                            Fluid Boundaries explores how adaptive kitchenware can support older adults in maintaining agency, comfort, and 
dignity while cooking, eating, and 
navigating domestic routines. The project investigates how design can empower aging individuals by reshaping tools and spaces they once relied on—rather than removing them from those environments.

design with empathy and foresight grows. This project frames aging not as decline, but as a transition requiring thoughtful, 
inclusive design. Through interviews, observation, and prototyping, it explores how the kitchen—a site of memory, care, and identity—can evolve to meet users where they are.

                        <p>Designing solutions for climbing gear organization presents numerous opportunities to enhance the climbing experience by addressing common issues faced by climbers. Innovative design can lead to the development of integrated storage systems that consolidate essential gear into compact, easy-to-carry formats. For example, designing multi-functional bags that incorporate compartments for climbing shoes, chalk bags, water bottles, and brushes can streamline the transportation and accessibility of gear. Additionally, using durable, lightweight materials can make these solutions more practical for everyday use. Incorporating features like modular attachments, magnetic closures, and quick-access pockets can further improve organization and convenience. 
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, other opportunities lie in enhancing overall climbing experience through management of chalk and preventing contamination of other gear. A multitude of approaches can be taken, such as airtight closures that prevent leaks and using materials that repel chalk dust. Furthermore, designing systems that separate the working and storage layers to prevent cross contamination is also explored. 
                        <br><br>
                        Such design innovations not only reduce clutter and safety hazards in climbing gyms but also enhance the efficiency and satisfaction of climbers, allowing them to focus more on their performance and less on managing their equipment. This intersection of functionality, safety, and user experience offers a rich field for creative and impactful design solutions in the climbing industry.

                        <p>Upon testing, most of the brushes on the market suffer the same issues where the user's knuckles grind against the climbing hold or wall during use. A combination of a 7 degree angled brush head and offset handle solved this issue through various prototypes.
                            <br><br>
                            To reduce the number of brushes that needs to be carried by the climber, the chalk brush is redesigned so that the small brush fits inside and functions as a part of the large brush. The small brush is able to detach from the large brush when the climber needs to brush smaller holds or tighter angles.
